## Which Stock to choose?

* Which quantity to track per stock?
  * Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Adjusted (Yahoo)?
  * OpCl(GS) #daily percent change open to close
  * OpOp(GS) #one period open to open change
  * HiCl(GS) #the percent change from high to close 
  * As we consider the monthly value, do we aggregate per month or just take the value at the end of the month?

## Own Research

* Cost total capital: cost debt (total debt) + cost of equity (stock)
  * Cost debt: interest expense/total debt 
  * Cost of equity: dividend payment rate (typical, donâ€™t change much) / stock price; 

* REITS
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_REITs_in_Canada
  * Mortgage REITS vs rental REITS. What would be a good indicator? Analyze the investment mandate of these REITS to determine whether inclusion is appropriate
    * discard mortgage REITS: they buy mortgage debts; they don't own buildings; 
  
* Dividents vs Stocks vs ETFs
  * Dividend yields will only reflect dividend paying stocks. Which I believe are heavily weighted to the banks in the TSX. 
  * ETFs: ETFs are really just ways for investors to easily get diversified exposure, whether that be to the broad market or within an specific industry (ie JETS, airline ETF in the US) ,without having to purchases shares of each company and rebalancing portfolios.
  
* IATD purchases monthly data from the TMX group (Vivian's group)
  


Construction and engineering stocks include companies that build residential and non-residential building construction, contract services and other building, material and infrastructure related companies.


* Real estate investment trust (REIT):  company that owns, and in most cases operates, income-producing real estate. REITs own many types of ***commercial*** real estate,

* S&P/TSX Composite Index contains a few companies labeled as construction
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P/TSX_Composite_Index
* TD International Equity Index ETF Units: Goes ony back to 2016.


* Could US construction indices be valuable? How close are the Canadian and US markets linked?
* How about bonds, mutual funds or other trading tools?
