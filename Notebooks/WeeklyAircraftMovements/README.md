# Weekly Aircraft Movements Data

Data on the weekly base has been published on over the last months, due to Covid-19.
The process is in part managed by Krishna (DScD), who receives daily counts and aggregates
the counts to weekly base. SM is then publishing this data.

* Releases are on Wednesdays, e.g. release June 17th; release May30 -June 5
* Time series is short! Only available starting Dec 18

### Discussion with Krishna

* Krishna's code creates weekly counts are exact to monthly, he reproduced the monthly counts: 
* could we get the weekly counts from Krishna instead of using the monthly data?
* will the weekly counts be available for the next years to come? Ask SM about engagement
