### Goals

* Authomatically downloading weather and climate data

### Comments

* For downloading data from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) website,
we use package `weathercan` which can be installed directly from CRAN. 

* To downlaod data using this package, we need to know the `station_id`
associated with the station we are interested in.
